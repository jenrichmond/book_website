title: "my book_website sandpit"

This is a Quarto website. I have been asking my boyfriend Claude about how to embed a Quarto book within a website. I think I have followed his instructions, including the book in its own folder, but when I render the site the nav bar Book only links to the first page of the book and doesn't show the rest of the book.

When I render files in the book folder separately, it works just fine.

Claude says that the repo should be structured as so...

And the \_quarto.yml for the book should look like this...
