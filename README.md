I have created a little reprex to illustrate what I am trying to create with the Rladies Sydney website. 
I would like one of the nav bar items to link to the new RYouWithme content, which I have created as a Quarto book. 
I have been asking Claude about how to embed a book within a website and his suggestions for repo structure and _quarto.yml make sense, 
but when I render the whole site, only the first page of the book shows up. 

Can you please take a look and let me know what I might be missing??

THANKS!
Jen
